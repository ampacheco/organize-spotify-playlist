# Organize Spotify Playlist

A couple of years ago I created a [Spotify's playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4FO6rgOkMYPlIg8Zt7CK2v?si=axfNAfnASBiuEve3y-_iwg) where I add all tracks I liked, just as the main repository of things I'd like to listen to, no matter the mood I was when I added that song. As time goes, this playlist became less enjoyable to listen due to the change in rhythm - From listen to a [Metal song](https://open.spotify.com/track/3z5ggGtcs4t8pizW521gW9?si=arc-Mcc1Sh6PS2kQ9umvVw) it jumps to [Bossa Nova](https://open.spotify.com/track/5xTt7WCmlfdSa9aP3MV56A?si=kYk4HNgsTuazBYfwoAYvpA), which is very annoying. This post contains a few data science approaches I applied to organize this playlist and what worked and what didn't.
